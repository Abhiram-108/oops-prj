# Math Solver

Welcome to the Math Solver repository! This project implements a comprehensive mathematical solver using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++. It can handle a wide range of mathematical problems, from basic arithmetic to complex integral calculus.

## Features

- **Supports Various Operations**: 
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
  - Advanced operations including Trigonometric, Logarithmic, and Exponential functions
  - Integral and Differential Calculus

- **Modular Design**: Utilizes OOP principles to create modular and reusable code.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for user interaction.

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for invalid inputs and operations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-solver.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd math-solver
    ```
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler, e.g., g++:
    ```sh
    g++ -o math-solver src/*.cpp
    ```
4. Run the executable:
    ```sh
    ./math-solver
    ```

## Usage

- Follow the prompts to input mathematical expressions or problems.
- The program will process the input and return the calculated result.
- You can perform multiple operations in one session.
